# Sudoku-Game

Sudoku is a popular logic-based number puzzle game that requires the player to fill in a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9. The grid is divided into 9 smaller 3x3 sub-grids, each of which must also be filled with digits from 1 to 9. The goal of the game is to fill in the grid with digits so that each row, column, and sub-grid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating any digit.

The program uses the concept of backtracking. In this program, we have hard-coded the initial values, but you can also get the same input from the user (though that will be cumbersome for this program). The main thing to understand is the backtracking to find rows and columns that are not assigned any values (are zero).
